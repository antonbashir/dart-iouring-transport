/**
 * 96-bit signed integer.
 * 1)Negative integer is stored as 96-bit two's complement
 * 2)Stores an integer modulo n, where n = 2**96
 * Actually (1) == (2), as the wave-particle duality.
 * Designed for storing integers in range [INT64_MIN, UINT64_MAX],
 * and detecting overflow (out of range [INT64_MIN, UINT64_MAX])
 * after operations (addition, subtraction) on them.
 * The base fact is when two uint64_t or int64_t values
 * are converted to int96, and then added or subtracted, the
 * int96 arithmetics cannot overflow. Actually you need at least
 * billions of adding UINT64_MAX or INT64_MIN to make it overflow.
 * Addition is implemented directly;
 * For subtraction use addition of inverted number.
