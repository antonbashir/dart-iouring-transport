# 👋 Hello

Greetings. Welcome to the documentation of the dart-iouring-transport (DIOT) library.

The main purpose of this project is the implementation of different kinds of transport using io_uring Linux API.

# 🧠 Reasoning


# 🔨 Usage

1. Initiate a Dart project with `pubspec.yaml`.
2. Append the following section to your dependencies:
```yaml
  iouring_transport:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/antonbashir/dart-iouring-transport/
      path: dart
```
3. Run `dart pub get`.
4. Refer to the [API](/category/-api) for implementation details. Enjoy!

# 💥 Samples

A basic sample of usage lives [here](https://github.com/antonbashir/dart-iouring-sample).

# ✋ Limitations

There are some features which I don't implement:
* non-Linux platform - because of IOUring

# 👨‍💻 Contribution

Issues about wanted functions or existing bugs are always welcome.
