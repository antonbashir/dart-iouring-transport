# üëã Hello

Greetings. Welcome to the documentation of the dart-iouring-transport (DIOT) library.

The main purpose of this project is the implementation of different kinds of transport using io_uring Linux API.

# üß† Reasoning

I need a transport. I need to communicate over the network and with the file system. 

Also, I want to use Dart. 

Current Dart IO implementation is based on Linux sockets, files, and EPOLL. 

The implementation is hidden inside Dart SDK and if I want to improve it, there will be complications.

So, I've decided to take the most performant and modern Linux IO - `io_uring` and implement my own IO with Dart.

Implemented features:
* TCP
* UDP
* UNIX socket streams
* Files
* Asynchronous execution (leveraging Dart streams and futures)

# üî® Usage

:::warning
There are requirements for Linux configuration to launch DIOT-based projects:

```title="security.limits"
*     hard      nofile      1048576
*     soft      nofile      1048576
*     hard      memlock     unlimited
*     soft      memlock     unlimited
```

And some optimal configurations (`rmem` and `wmem` are very important values):
```title="sysctl.conf"
fs.file-max = 2097152
vm.swappiness = 10
vm.dirty_ratio = 60
vm.dirty_background_ratio = 2

net.ipv4.tcp_synack_retries = 2
net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 2000 65535
net.ipv4.tcp_rfc1337 = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 15

net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time = 300
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_probes = 5
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_intvl = 15

net.core.rmem_default = 31457280
net.core.rmem_max = 33554432
net.core.wmem_default = 31457280
net.core.wmem_max = 33554432
net.core.somaxconn = 65535
net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 65536
net.core.optmem_max = 25165824

net.ipv4.tcp_mem = 786432 1048576 26777216
net.ipv4.udp_mem = 65536 131072 262144

net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 8192 87380 33554432
net.ipv4.udp_rmem_min = 16384

net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 8192 65536 33554432
net.ipv4.udp_wmem_min = 16384

net.ipv4.tcp_max_tw_buckets = 1440000
```

1. Initiate a Dart project with `pubspec.yaml`.
2. Append the following section to your dependencies:
```yaml
  iouring_transport:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/antonbashir/dart-iouring-transport/
      path: dart
```
3. Run `dart pub get`.
4. Refer to the [API](/category/-api) for implementation details. Enjoy!

# üí• Samples

A basic sample of usage lives [here](https://github.com/antonbashir/dart-iouring-sample).

# ‚úã Limitations

There are some features which I don't implement:
* non-Linux platform - because of IOUring

# üë®‚Äçüíª Contribution

Issues about wanted functions or existing bugs are always welcome.
