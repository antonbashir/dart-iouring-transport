# API

## Transport

Transport is the main entry point to configure IO.

:::tip
You could call the `shutdown` method if you want to close all IO workers
:::

```dart title="Declaration"
class Transport {
  Transport({String? libraryPath})
  Future<void> shutdown({Duration? gracefulTimeout}) async
  SendPort worker(TransportWorkerConfiguration configuration)
```

```dart title="Example"
final transport = Transport();
final worker = TransportWorker(transport.worker(TransportDefaults.worker()));
await worker.initialize();

/* Do some work */

/* Handle stop on your own */

await transport.shutdown();
```

### Methods

#### shutdown

Stops all workers and destroys transport objects.

#### worker

Creates a new SendPort which could be used to create a new `TransportWorker`.
